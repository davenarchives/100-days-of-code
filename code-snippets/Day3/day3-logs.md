# 100 Days of Code - Day 3: Learning Flexbox

### 📅 Day 3 - Mastering CSS Flexbox

> Today, I explored CSS Flexbox, which is a powerful layout module that allows for flexible and responsive designs. I practiced different Flexbox properties such as justify-content, align-items, flex-direction, and order to arrange elements dynamically.

## 📌 What I Learned

1️⃣ Justifying Content

> justify-content: center: Centers elements horizontally.

> justify-content: space-evenly: Distributes items evenly with equal space.

> justify-content: flex-end: Aligns items to the end of the container.

> justify-content: space-between: Places elements at the start and end, with equal spacing in between.

2️⃣ Aligning Items in the Center

> align-items: center: Centers items vertically in a container.

> Combining justify-content: center and align-items: center results in fully centered elements.

3️⃣ Changing Flex Direction

> flex-direction: row-reverse: Reverses item order in a row.

> flex-direction: column: Stacks elements vertically.

> flex-direction: column-reverse: Reverses column order.

4️⃣ Ordering Elements

> order property: Allows rearranging elements in a flex container.

> Example: .c3 { order: -2; } moves item C3 before others.
